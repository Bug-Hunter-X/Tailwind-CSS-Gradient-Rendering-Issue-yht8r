# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Tailwind CSS gradients:  inconsistent rendering across different browsers or due to CSS conflicts. The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.html` provides a fix.

## Problem

The gradient defined using Tailwind's `bg-gradient-to-r` utility may not render correctly in all browsers, particularly older ones.  This can also be caused by conflicting CSS styles with higher specificity.
